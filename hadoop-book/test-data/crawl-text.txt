http://zookeeper.apache.org/	Apache ZooKeeper Home Apache ZooKeeper Welcome to Apache ZooKeeper Apache ZooKeeper is an effort to develop and maintain an open source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination What is ZooKeeper ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information naming providing distributed synchronization and providing group services All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services applications initially usually skimp on them which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage Even when done correctly different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed Learn more about ZooKeeper on the ZooKeeper Wiki Getting Started Start by installing ZooKeeper on a single machine or a very small cluster Learn about ZooKeeper by reading the documentation Download ZooKeeper from the release page Getting Involved Apache ZooKeeper is an open source volunteer project under the Apache Software Foundation We encourage you to learn about the project and contribute your expertise Here are some starter links See our How to Contribute to ZooKeeper page Give us feedback What can we do better Join the mailing list Meet the community Project News Releases Wiki Credits Bylaws License Privacy Policy Sponsorship Thanks Security Subprojects BookKeeper with Hedwig Documentation Release Release Release Release Trunk Developers Mailing Lists IRC Channel Version Control Issue Tracker Copyright The Apache Software Foundation Licensed under the Apache License Version Apache ZooKeeper ZooKeeper Apache the Apache feather logo and the Apache ZooKeeper project logo are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation
